# Git Assignment Project

This repository holds all the practical assignments from each week’s coursework. After completing each practical, I carefully reviewed my code against the instructor’s solutions to ensure accuracy and correctness. The assignments are organized by week, with detailed outputs stored in the corresponding README.md files.

I followed a structured Git workflow throughout the course: each practical was developed in its own branch, and a pull request (PR) was created and merged into the main branch to maintain a clean version control history. This process mirrors standard production practices, ensuring each practical was handled with proper version management.
