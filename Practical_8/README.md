## Practical 8

GCD with both Iteration and Recursion

Using Euler's method
loop until a = 0
	a,b = b ,a(mod)b


### Program output

**gcd.c **

Execute: 
gcc -o gcd gcd.c

./gcd

```Shell
Enter the values of a and b(separated by space:15 20

The greatest common divisor of a and b(Iterative): 5
The greatest common divisor of a and b(Recursive): 5
```
