## Practical 2

- First prgram is to convert decimal to binary in C
- Second program is to add as series of number and get the sum and then check the difference when the series is reversed.


### Program outputs

**Conversion\ -\ Copy.c **

Execute: 
gcc -o Conv Conversion\ -\ Copy.c -lm
./Conv

```Shell
The number of digits is 25
inum=33554431,  fnum=33554432.000000, inum in binary=1111111111111111111111111
```

**Sum.c**

Execute:

gcc -o sum Sum.c -lm
./sum

```Shell
 Sum1=7.485478
 Sum2=7.485472
 Difference between the two is -0.000007
```
